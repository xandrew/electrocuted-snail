    <p><b>Snail mail and paper documents suck.</b></p>

    <p>You don't know where to put them when they arrive. You don't know where to find them when you need them. You store tons of old documents that could be safely thrown away, if only you knew which ones.</p>

    <p><i>I'm here to help by converting your papers into emails!</i></p>
    
    <h3>Get started</h3>
    <p>When a new physical document (snail mail, warranty, doctor's note, ...) appears, start the electrocution process by visiting
      <a href="https://electrocuted-snail.com"
	 target="_blank">electrocuted-snail.com</a> on your phone. Log in, and just follow the steps! Other than the first and the last steps, everything is optional.
    </p>
    
    <h3>1 Photo/scan</h3>
    <p>First, I'll ask you to snap a photo of your document. Make multiple photos if there are multiple pages - but only if you care about keeping those in the email as well.</p>
    <p>(Alternatively, you can log in from a computer and attach a scan.)</p>
    <p>Your electrocuted mail will contain the photos/scan as attachement. I also run OCR and include the recognized text, allowing your email client to search in these documents!</p>
    <h3>2 Tags - if you want to organize your electrocuted documents</h3>
    <p>You can define tags and then tag electorcuted documents. These generate unique strings into the email body which you can use to automatically and reliably tag your emails via filters or sort them into folders - whatever your email system supports. (For example,
      <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en"
	 target="_blank">here</a>
      are the docs for gmail.)</p>
    <h3>3 Notes - add free form text into your electrocuted document</h3>
    <p>Add any additional info not contained in the document itself. Was the bill payed? Did your doctor say something she didn't write down? Do you have some extra info on how to use your warranty? This is the place for these.</p>
    <h3>4 Hard copy storage - if you still need the physical document</h3>
    <p>Most of the time you don't even need to store the physical document. Once it's converted into an email you can safely toss the original.</p>
    <p>But if you do need to keep them then I encourage you to store physical documents in folders organized by expiration date - the date when it's safe to toss the document to the garbage. This way cleanup is easy: every new year you can throw away everything in the folders labeled by that year.</p>
    <p>Within a given folder, store documents alphabetically by a short ID assigned by Me.</p>
    <p>Of course, when you need a document you typically don't want to look for it by expiration date, so this organization is useless for retrieval. But that's cool! You should use the emails for all meaningful organization and search tasks. Once you've found the corresponding email - using search (thanks to OCR) or whatever electornic organization system you see fit (see tags above) - then you are all set: the email will point you to an exact folder and an exact ID, so you can easily find the physical document in that folder.</p>
    <h3>5 Electrocuting</h3>
    <p>As a last step, just press the Go Electrocute button. Your document - together with all the extra information mentioned above - will be converted into an email.</p>
    <p>I do not store any part of this data. Storage is totally up to your email provider.</p>
    <p>This is good from a privacy and security point of view: you don't have to trust me with the safety of your electrocuted documents or worry about any missuse. It's all up to your - hopefully already trusted - email host.</p>
    <p>But remember, emails do get lost sometimes, and if this happens, we have no way to recover your data. So don't do anything irreversible - like shredding a document - before you have actually received the corresponding email!<p>
