  Snail mail and paper documents suck. You don't know where to put them when they arrive. You don't know where to find them when you need them. You store tons of old documents that could easily be thrown away, but who has the time to find and discard these.

  Electrocuted Snail is here to help by converting your papers into email!

  <h3>0</h3>
  <p>When a new physical document (snail mail, warranty, doctor's note, ...) arrives, start the electrocution process to create an email out of it.</p>
  <h3>1 Photo/scan</h3>
  <p>First, snap a photo of your document with your phone. Make multiple photos if there are multiple pages - but only if you care about keeping those in the email as well. Alternatively, you can attach a scan.</p>
  <p>Your electrocuted mail will contain the photos as attachement. We also run OCR and include the recognized text, allowing your email client to search in those documents!</p>
  <h3>2 Tags - if you want to organize your electrocuted documents</h3>
  <p>You can define tags and then tag new incoming documents. These generate unique strings into the email body which you can use to automatically sort your emails via folders or tags, or whatever your email system supports.</p>
  <h3>3 Notes - add free form text into your electrocuted document</h3>
  <p>Add any additional info not contained in the document itself. Was the bill payed? Did your doctor say something she didn't write down? Do you have some extra info on how to use your warranty? This is the place for these.</p>
  <h3>4 Hard copy storage - if you still need the physical document</h3>
  <p>Most of the time you don't even need to store the physical document. Once it's converted into an email you can safely toss the original.</p>
  <p>But if you do need to keep them then Electrocuted Snail encourages you to store physical documents in folders organized by expiration date - the date when it's safe to toss the document to the garbage. This way cleanup is easy: every new year you can throw away everything in the folders labeled by that year.</p>
  <p>Within a given folder, store documents alphabetically by an ID assigned by Electrocuted Snail.</p>
  <p>Of course, when you need a document you typically don't want to look for it by expiration date, so this organization is useless for retrieval. But that's cool: you should use the emails for all meaningful organization and search tasks! Once you've found the corresponding email - using search (thanks to OCR) or whatever electornic organization system you see fit (see tags above) - then you are all good: the email will point you to an exact folder and an exact ID, so you can easily find the physical document in that folder.</p>
  <h3>5 Electrocuting</h3>
  <p>As a last step, just press the Go Electrocute button. Your document - together with all the extra information mentioned above - will be converted into an email.</p>
  <p>Electrocuted Snail does not store any part of this data. Storage is totally up to your email provider.</p>
  <p>This is good from a privacy and security point of view: you don't have to trust another provider with the safety of your electrocuted documents, it's all up to your - hopefully already trusted - email host.</p>
  <p>But remember, emails do get lost sometimes, and if this happens, we have no way to recover your data. So don't do anything irreversible - like shredding a document - before you have actually received the electrocuted copy.
